The organisations forming the Open Energy Access Alliance believe that access to energy is fundamental to human and economic development. They also believe that decentralised approaches to energy provision are vital in achieving universal energy access.

As part of their work towards supporting Sustainable Development Goal 7 –  to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all – we actively support the development and shared use of open data, hardware and software. We also believe in technology transfer to the countries in which the majority of energy access work must take place and espouse open source as a crucial technology transfer mechanism.

In joining the Open Energy Access Alliance, members agree that:

1. A significant part of their technology and/or data, that relevant to the energy access domain, is fully open source, including designs, codes and manuals, using the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license;
2. Technology and/or data will be made available through the Alliance within 12 months of a product being released to market;
3. Open source code will be available through a shared and easily accessible repository;
4. An Alliance website will contain information about members and their products;
5. Members may wish, but are not obliged, to enter into commercial arrangement with other members when working with their technologies;
6. All modified technology must be shared with the Alliance promptly, under the same license that the original technology was shared under, and must be shared through the alliance;
7. ‘Authorship’ must be clearly noted for original and modified technology;
8. To join the alliance, an application for membership must be approved by greater than 50% of the members;
9. With approval of greater than 50% of the members, a member may be removed from the alliance, should they be in breach of any of these terms.
