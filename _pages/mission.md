The Open Energy Access Alliance was established by a small group of organisations, sharing the belief that access to energy is fundamental for human and economic development and that decentralised approaches to energy provision are vital for achieving universal energy access. The founding members’ common passion is to facilitate access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy sources, in line with the [UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 7](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/energy/). In order to achieve this, each organisation is proactively committed to the open source movement, including the utilisation, development and sharing of open hardware, software and data. We encourage technology transfer to the countries requiring greater levels of energy access, and we advocate the open source approach as a crucial technology transfer mechanism - allowing, rather than restricting, further development or modifications by other people for specific contexts.

Organisations sharing our passion for, and commitment to, facilitating greater access to energy, through an open source approach, are welcome to apply for membership. All members must agree to and sign the Open Energy Access Alliance Declaration.
