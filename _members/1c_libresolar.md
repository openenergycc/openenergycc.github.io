The mission of Libre Solar is to help reclaiming the energy supply using affordable, modular and distributed renewable energy solutions based on open source hardware. The main focus of Libre Solar is solar electricity generation and storage. Accordingly, the initial open source hardware projects are an MPPT charge controller and a battery management system for Lithium ion batteries.

The primary ideas of a smart, distributed and hackable DC energy system emerged from discussions during the [POC21 innovation camp](http://www.poc21.cc/) near Paris in September, 2015. We were planning to combine different renewable energy sources of the single projects (solar generator, $30 wind turbine, bicycle generator) into a system which would be able to provide energy for small household consumers, green houses, electric bikes, etc.. The only problem: There were no open-source and hackable power electronics devices available which would fulfill our needs. 

Since then, we are trying to close this gap and develop flexible solar charge controllers, mobile solar systems and battery management systems as open-source hardware projects.

Libre Solar is closely linked to the Fablab [Fabulous St. Pauli](http://www.fablab-hamburg.org/), which provides necessary tools for prototyping like a laser cutter, a reflow oven and 3D printers. A small solar system based on the Libre Solar MPPT is also installed in the Fablab.
