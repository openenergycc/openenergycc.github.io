Libre Solar was established by Martin JÃ¤ger, and is based in Hamburg, Germany. Their mission is to help reclaim energy supply using affordable, modular and distributed renewable energy solutions based on open source hardware to enable renewable energy to be accessible to all. The main focus of Libre Solar is solar electricity generation and storage using open source hardware, specifically the development of flexible solar charge controllers, mobile solar systems and battery management systems. Accordingly, the initial open source hardware projects are an MPPT charge controller and a battery management system for Lithium ion batteries.
